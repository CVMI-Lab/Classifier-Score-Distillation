# Text-to-3D with Classifier Score Distillation

## Introduction
This repository includes the implementation of applying Classifier Score Distillation [(CSD)](https://github.com/CVMI-Lab/Classifier-Score-Distillation) to a diffusion prior with multi-view capabilities (i.e., [MVDream](https://github.com/bytedance/MVDream-threestudio)), which effectively addresses the Janus problem.

## Installation
The codebase is built upon the MVDream-threestudio framework. Please follow the installation instructions available at the MVDream-threestudio repository for environment setup: [MVDream-threestudio Repo](https://github.com/bytedance/MVDream-threestudio).

## Running the Code
To run the Classifier Score Distillation (CSD) code, simply execute the provided `run.sh` script.

## Credits
This codebase is built upon the [Threestudio](https://github.com/threestudio-project/threestudio) and [MVDream](https://github.com/bytedance/MVDream-threestudio). Thanks to the authors for their great codebase and contribution to the community.
